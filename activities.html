			I am outgoing. I like to join all kinds of group activities such as hiking, exercising, and swimming.<br>
			This is a very beautiful hiking trail at Origen, which I already forgot the name. It is a very clear day, and all of us love it...

			On the weekends, I like to go to performance with friends, and I like to be in the audience, to appreciate the arts whoever is performing... This is a play, <em> Othello, </em> at Shakespeare's Globe in London. We only can get the standing tickets, and I found myself enjoyed much more than a seated one.

			Sometimes, I dream to become a little mermaid to discover the world under the water. This is when I first learned how to swim last year... Since then, I always invite my friends to go swimming whenever they come to visit me.
